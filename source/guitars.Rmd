### Introduction

A few years ago, a friend of mine - I'll call him 'CalFrog' - challenged me to build a bass guitar.  The end result was the short-scale bass shown below.  Since then, I've made a couple more instruments and it seemed like it would be good to capture the process that goes into making something like this.  This is how I do it, based on the tools I have available and the techniques that I'm comfortable with.  Clearly, there's more than one possible way to end up in a similar place, but I feel reasonably confident that I'll end up with something usable doing it this way.

### Decisions, Decisions, Decisions

The guitar, like any musical instrument, is the sum of its parts.  In order to make something that is both playable and maintainable, decisions must be made regarding the size, shape and configuration of the instrument.  Almost all of these choices affect some aspect of playability and how different parts of the intrument interact with each other.  There are __very few__ things on the guitar which only have an aesthetic effect when changed.  

Here are the main items to think about before starting construction.

- Guitar or Bass?
- Body type?
- Number of strings?
- Scale length?
- Number of frets?
- Headstock shape?
- Pickup type and configuration?
- Controls; type and layout?

Let's go through each of these, individually, below.

### Guitar, Bass (or something else?)
Seems self-evident, but since you're building it, there are no limits.  Case in point, I've been playing a 5-string, baritone scale guitar that I made for myself a few years ago.  You can make an 8-string bass, 4-string mandolin, etc.  The point is that you need to know what you're making.  Some of the parts you need to buy are not interchangeable between different types of instruments.  Specifically the tuners, bridge and/or tailpiece need to match the style of instrument and the string gauge that you're working with.  To a lesser extent, the same thing is true of the pickups, although in some cases the same pickup will work in either a guitar or bass.

### Body Type
By this I mean "body construction", not so much the shape.  There are some ramifications from choosing a specific shape that I'll go over briefly, but the construction of the body is more important.  The main choices are solid-body, semi-hollow and hollow-body and I should specify that I am only talking about steel-string electric guitars/basses here.  Fully acoustic guitars like a Martin dreadnought or nylon-string Classical guitar are something entirely different.  The 3 body types - solid, semi-hollow and hollow - differ by the amount of air space in the body.  

__Solid Body :__ The Gibson Les Paul and Fender Stratocaster are both examples of solid-body guitars.  Essentially it's a slab of wood that cut into the shape of a guitar which then has a neck attached to it.  

__Semi-hollow Body :__ The semi-hollow body is like a Gibson ES-335, or Epiphone Sheraton (essentially the same guitar) and is a hollow body guitar with a large block of wood in the center. The block of wood gives a place for the neck and pickups to attach to and changes the resonating characteristics of the guitar. The semi-hollow guitar has a bit of a solid body's sustain, while at the same time giving some acoustic resonance.  It will feedback like crazy whan played at high volumes, especially with distortion, and many players will stuff the body with rags or foam to deaden the acoustic resonance.

__Hollow Body :__  The fully hollow electric guitar, like the Gibson ES-150 and the L5  has a fully hollow body and is optimized for its acoustic qualities.  The construction of these guitars is highly specialized and in many ways exemplifies the luthier's art.  Most often these are archtop guitars used primarily for playing jazz and are not well suited for genres of music that are played at high volumes with distortion.  That being said, I'm sure someone out there is playing metal on a jazz archtop and having fun doing it.

__Effect of Body Type :__ Body type is important for more than just helping you look like your favorite musical hero.  As mentioned above, body type has a huge impact on the resonating characteristics of the instrument.  A solid-body guitar will sustain longer and have a brighter sound than a hollow-body, which is exactly why Les Paul designed the guitar that bears his name in this manner.  Although he didn't design the guitar for playing Rock and Roll, the enhanced sustain and brightness work well for that genre.  Jazz on the other hand, which tends to favor a rounder, more full tone, lends itself well to semi-hollow and hollow-body guitars.  That said, just look at John Scofield and realize that there are no hard and fast rules.  In addition to the tonal charactersitics, the body type has a big role in the overall weight of the instrument.  A hollow Gibson ES-150 weighs in at 5.5 pounds, whereas a solid Les Paul can be around 9 pounds.  Granted, weight is also a function of the wood type and other details, since a semi-hollw ES-335 also weighs around 9 pounds.  Generally speaking though, a hollow instrument will weigh less than a solid one.
