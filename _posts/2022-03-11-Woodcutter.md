Once there was a woodcutter who lived in a meadow by a large forest.  A beautiful stream ran through the meadow and the water from it powered a small sawmill.  The woodcutter used the sawmill to cut logs from the nearby forest into beams.  The work kept him busy and he was happy to create something of utility and value.

Nearby, on a mountain whose slopes rose from the woodcutter's meadow, there was a tower.  Located at the very peak of the mountain, the tower was made of brick and very tall.  From the top, one could see far into the distance and all around it.  A crew of bricklayers worked tirelessly to raise the tower ever higher. One-by-one, they added bricks to the top, while also knocking out flawed bricks from sections they had built before.  From the top, one could see other towers being built on nearby mountains and it was important that this tower always be taller than them.  This tower needed to be the tallest.

Ensuring that enough bricks were available every day for the workers was a struggle, and because of the urgency of the work, sometimes mistakes were made in a new course of bricks.  Generally, the flaw wasn't discovered until a few other courses had been laid above it and careful planning was needed to remove the bad bricks without destabilizing the tower, or making it shorter.  Because, it was imperative that the tower stay taller than the other towers around it.

The woodcutter had an important job, which was to supply the beams used to support each floor in the tower.
