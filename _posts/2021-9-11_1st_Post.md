title: New Jekyll-Based Blog Underway
---

I figure that it's always good to be technically current within the last 20 years, sort of like being fashionably late to a party.  Hence my late exploration of Jekyll, which was initially conceived by one of Github's founders back in [2008](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).  I'm only 13 years behind, but hey, better late than never.

Actually, I've had some sort of lame attempt at a Blog up in the past, but I always found the overhead of maintaining it to be more of a pain in the butt than it was worth.  I tried out [Google's Blogspot](https://lagerratrobe.blogspot.com/) and got a few posts going in it, but it took more work than I wanted to commit to and it lacked the conceptual simplicity I was looking for.  We'll see how Jekyll does, but already I like what I'm seeing.

A few of my requirements for a Blog:

* It needs to be hosted as a Github "Page".  I'm expected to use git at work and I've gotten used to it. There is an industry wide assumption that people in the tech sphere know how to use Github and honestly, there are good reasons for that.  With respect to a Blog though, Github allows me to keep things organized and accessible across multiple computers easily.  Also, the "Pages" web hosting is free and "just works".
* Markdown needs to be supported.  I don't want to have to use RTF, or HTML formatted, chunks of text that I can only make in a special, Web browser based interface.  I want to be able to quickly jot something off in a text editor and fire it off.
* Ideally, all I have to do is post content and some other magic tool takes care of formatting it for me.
* No need to locally "build" the site after every new post is added.
* Allows for some degree of customization in the basic layout of the pages.

So far, it looks like Jekyll meets all of these requirements, but we'll see how it goes.  Thanks to [Barry Clark's](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) post from 2014 for getting this going.
