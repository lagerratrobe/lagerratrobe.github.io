title: New Jekyll-Based Blog Underway
---

I figure that it's always good to be technically current within the last 20 years, sort of like being fashionably late to a party.  Hence my late exploration of Jekyll, which was initially conceived by one of Github's founders back in [2008](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).  I'm only 13 years behind, but hey, better late than never.

Actually, I've had some sort of lame attempt at a Blog up in the past, but I always found the overhead of maintaining it to be more of a pain in the butt than it was worth.  This was the latest attempt, using R-Studio to build and manage a website.  It worked, but having to use R-Studio was kind of a pain and I hated having to build the site every time I made a change.

I also tried out [Google's Blogspot](https://lagerratrobe.blogspot.com/) and got a few posts going in it, but it took more work than I wanted to commit to and it lacked the conceptual simplicity I was looking for.  We'll see how Jekyll does, but already I like what I'm seeing.

A few of my requirements for a Blog:

* Needs to be hosted as a Github "Page".  They're free and "just work"
* Needs to use Markdown
* Ideally, all I have to do is post content and some other magic tool takes care of formatting it for me
* No dependency on locally "building" the site after new posts are added or edits are made
* _Some_ degree of customization available for altering the basic layout of pages
* Ability to post updates from any machine that has Github access and a text editor

So far, it looks like Jekyll meets all of these requirements, but we'll see how it goes.  Thanks to [Barry Clark's](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) post from 2014 for getting this going.
