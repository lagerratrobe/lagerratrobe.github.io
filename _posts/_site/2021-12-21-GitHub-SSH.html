<p>I keep forgetting the steps to do this, so for my benefit, here are the steps to enable an SSH connection to GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="basic-github-repo-cloning">Basic GitHub Repo Cloning</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Generate public ssh key
&gt; ssh-keygen -t rsa

2. Display the contents of the new public ssh key
&gt; cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

3. copy everything from "ssh-rsa" through end of email address

4. Add contents of rsa.pub into GitHub -&gt; Settings -&gt; SSH &amp; GPG Keys

5. Clone the repo
&gt; git clone git@gitlab.com:&lt;repo&gt;.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="getting-a-specific-branch">Getting a specific Branch</h2>

<p>The steps above will get you a basic repo over to your machine.  However, if you want to change into a specific branch of that repo, you need to do the following.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Change into the newly created repo folder (when you enter the repo, 
it shows the branch you're in, which is "master" by default)

&gt; cd &lt;repo_name&gt;
User@Machine MINGW64 ~/&lt;repo_name&gt; (master) 

2. Check to see what branches are available
$ git branch -av
* master                          59f116b Merge branch 'modify_algorithm' into 'master'
  remotes/origin/HEAD             -&gt; origin/master
  remotes/origin/master           59f116b Merge branch 'modify_algorithm' into 'master'
  remotes/origin/modify_algorithm 6e20ea3 added data files
  remotes/origin/national_run     c035975 completed national run

3. Grab one of the branches
&gt; git branch remotes/origin/national_run 

4. Change over to using the new branch
&gt; git checkout remotes/origin/national_run
warning: refname 'remotes/origin/national_run' is ambiguous.
Switched to branch 'remotes/origin/national_run'

User@Machine MINGW64 ~/&lt;repo_name&gt; (remotes/origin/national_run) 
</code></pre></div></div>
