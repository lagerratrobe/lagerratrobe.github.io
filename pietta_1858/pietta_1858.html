<p align="left">Thoughts and information on a Pietta replica of the Remington 1858 cap and ball revolver.
<h3 align="center">First Firing (11/11/2016)</h3>
<p align="left">Spent an enjoyable couple of hours at the Issaquah Sportsmen's Club range on Veteran's Day.  They had free range admission for veterans and I took advantage of my day off to go shoot my new Pietta Remington 1858.  I was able to shoot 50 balls downrange before fouling made the action of the revolver too stiff to operate properly.  Aside from the fouling, the gun worked perfectly.  I used Pyrodex P pellets with a lubed wad and a .454 Hornady swaged ball.  Ignition was achieved with Remington #10 caps through SlixShot nipples.  

<p align="left">The range operates on a 20 minutes "on", 10 minutes "off" policy.  During the "off" period, shooters are able to go downrange and swap targets out.  I found that I was comfortably able to load and shoot 2 cylinders during each "on" period, with a full reload taking between 5 to 7 minutes to perform.  My preferred method of reloading was to remove the cylinder, load a pellet and wad in the chambers, reinstall the cylinder, ram the lead balls and then cap the nipples.  I was only able to do this 4 times though, after which I could no longer move the cylinder retaining pin to free the cylinder.  The remaining shots were loaded with the cylinder in the gun and the hammer at half-cock during the entire process.  Although the cylinder pin became stuck early on, the rest of the gun's action continued to work properly during the rest of the session.

<p align="left">I shot at 4 paper NRA rifle targets from a distance of 7 yards.  While this is an extremely close distance, I had no idea where the gun would shoot and thought it prudent to start from a close distance. This distance also closely matches the 7 meter distance used as part of the Military Police Pistol Qualification Course, which I am familiar with, and felt comfortable.  Previous research had led me to believe that the gun would shoot low as a result of the extremely high front sight it comes with.  I was not disappointed.  Initial shots were about 10-12 inches below my point of aim (POA).  They also tended to be slightly left of center, but I believe this was due to errors in my shooting stance.  My previous pistol shooting experience is entirely with automatics and I am not yet comfortable with how these classic revolver grips fit my hand.  That being said, I was able to quickly find a 2-handed shooting stance that seemed to work adequately well and felt stable.  Best accuracy and grouping was obtained by shooting from a supported position with my hands resting on a padded bench.  Shooting in that manner gave me a 3 inch group of 8 shots that was well centered in the target.  To be honest, these shots feel like somewhat of a fluke on my part. They do however reassure me that the gun is capable of shooting accurately.  Further practice on my part is needed to do this in a repeatable manner.
