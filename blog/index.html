                                <p>A sentiment I've heard expressed a few times recently and one which I've felt myself is, <em>"Where do I start?"</em>.  With so many options in mapping technology available now, all slickly marketed and hyped to death, it can feel overwhelming for someone trying to get started.  The answer, of course, is to start from the beginning. </p>
                                <p><em>What are you trying to show, and how do you want to communicate it to your audience?</em>  These 2 things should help you decide what tool or platform to use.  Here are some questions to consider related to these.</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>How much of the globe and what part of it are you interested in showing?</li>
                                <li>What do you need to show?</li>
                                <li>How are you going to style your map?</li>
                                <li>How are you going to present your map?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h4>How much of the globe and what part of it are you interested in showing?</h4>
                                <p>This makes a difference with regards to the map projection that will work best for you.  Don't know what a map projection is? No problem.  Find a tennis ball and a flat piece of paper.  The ball is the Earth, the paper is your computer screen. Now wrap the ball with the paper.  Doesn't look like very good, does it?  A map projection is the shape-shifting mathematical voodoo that allows your rectangular computer screen (and in ye olden days, a paper map) to display a section of (or the entire) ball in a way that doesn't necessitate you dropping acid to make sense of what you're seeing.  The more of the ball that you want to show in your map, the more the projection matters.  </p>

                                </div>
                                <p>The other factor I mentioned here was what part of the globe you're trying to show.  This matters, again, because of the map projection.  Basically, the closer your area of interest is to the poles and the bigger that area is, the fewer of the <em>NewMappingHotness.com</em> options will work for you.  This is because most of them only support 2 projections that start to look like crap when you get North of Edmonton, CAN.  Pretty much the hardest thing to show in <em>NewMappingHotness</em> is something like a <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=87528">map of polar ice recession</a>.  You can see why pretty easily, just fire up Google Maps and do a search for, "The North Pole".  Good luck with that.  It's not that Google Maps is bad, it's just that in order to give you a map that let's you zoom in to (almost) any other part of the ball, something has to give and it's the Poles.  (BTW, Bing maps will at least try take you there, but it's still goofy looking.)</p>

                                <h4>What do you need to show?</h4>
                                <p>"A map", you say.  Well yes... but what things do you need <strong>on</strong> the map in order for you to tell your story?  Everything on <strong>your</strong> map should be there to help tell the story.  Look at these maps of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/18/us/chicago-murder-problem.html">murders in Chicago and New York by the NY Times</a>.  Everything on them  helps the reader to see where most murders take place, or where most segregation exists.  There is only enough data on each map to tell these stories and nothing else.  Roads, parks and water aren't labeled and there's only enough information there for a reader to make out where in the city they are looking.  These are beautiful maps that do their job well.  In order for your map to be effective, you need to identify the geographic features that <strong>you</strong> think are needed.  And that means that anything that you don't explicity identify has to go.  This will eliminate some of your options, as only a few of the <em>NewMappingHotness.com</em> platforms allow you to turn layers off.</p>

                                <h4>How are you going to style your map?</h4>
                                <p>This is entirely a function of what you're trying to show and what features you think need to be on the map to provide context.  For example, if I were going to make a map that showed all the public bathrooms on Naxos (Greek island in the Aegean), I would need to style the map differently than the Murder Capital map I mentioned above.  I would need to make the bathrooms very visible in contrast to the rest of the map, and I would need to have enough other features on the map that people could find the bathrooms, and I probably would need some labels as well.  And what if there were different kinds of bathrooms and I wanted to color them differently, maybe "flush" versus "hole in the ground"? And what if I wanted to also call out that some were "one-holers" versus "party-poopers"?  Maybe I'd use color to indicate type, and make the size of the dot proportional to the number of stalls, or something like that.  This again is something that will help you decide what tool to use.  Some make this sort of thing easier than others.</p>

                                <h4>And finally, how are you going to present your map?</h4>
                                <p>Is it going to be in a Web page, maybe on a blog that gets read both in mobile and other browsers?  Or is it going to be a figure in a PDF document that gets scaled up and down in size when it's read?  Or maybe it's actually going to be printed on paper?  (That bathroom map isn't very handy on an electronic device while you're wandering around Naxos on foot.)  Probably it will be a combination of those things.  The point being that you might need different output formats and not all mapping platforms support them.</p>
                                <p>So to sum up this monologue, before you implode from trying to decide which of the myriad of cool new toys to try out, figure out what you actually want to make first.  Once you have an idea, look for examples that are similar and see if you can determine how they were made.  Trust me, you're not that original.  Most of the <a href="http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/229-vital-statistics-of-a-deadly-campaign-the-minard-map">really cool maps</a> were made before computers and we're all just trying to catch up to what they made back then.</p>

<p>I prefer running R in Jupyter over using RStudio - no contest. I get intelligent formatting, direct access to help files and nice looking output which I can easily save to HTML and share.  By far the easiest way to get Jupyter running is to install Anaconda.  There are installers for WIndows, Mac and Linux and I've tried both the Windows and Linux binaries.  Personally, I find that using the Windows binaries for Anaconda is as annoying as using Git for Windows.  I just can't see the point of having all those specialized cmd shells for each program.  I much prefer just getting the Linux installer from Continuum and installing it in the Ubuntu WSL environment that's available in Windows 10 now.  Here are the steps to do that.</p>

<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> This assumes that you have already enabled the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p>

<p><strong>I.</strong> Open your Ubuntu terminal by hitting the Windows key and "R" at the same time and type, <em>bash</em>.</p>

<p><strong>II.</strong> Downloaded the latest Anaconda installer for Linux from Continuum:</p>
<pre><code>    $ wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh</code></pre>

<p><strong>III</strong>. Install the file by running it and deciding where you want to install it.  I installed it in <em>/usr/local</em>, which means that you'll have to execute the installer as sudo and specify a different install directory than the default.  (The default option works just fine though.)</p>
<pre><code>    $ sudo bash ./Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh</code></pre>

<p>You'll be prompted to accept the license agreement and then to either install in the default location, or in a place of your choosing.  Either way, at the end of the install you'll be asked if you want to add the path to anaconda in your local path.  Unless you know otherwise, say "Yes".</p>

<p><strong>IV.</strong> Optional:  Add the <em>anaconda3/bin</em> path to securepath with visudo so that you can install conda pkgs later using sudo: (This is not needed if you installed to the default location.)</p>

<pre><code>    $ sudo visudo
Add "/usr/local/anaconda3/bin" to securepath line.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>V.</strong>  Install some packages needed to make labels appear on R plots:</p>

<pre><code>    $ sudo apt-get install libxrender-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libxext-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VI.</strong> Install R essentials and an R kernel:</p>

<pre><code>    $ sudo conda install r-essentials
    $ sudo conda install r-irkernel
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VII.</strong> Run it!</p>

<pre><code>    $ jupyter notebook --no-browser

<p>I recently had a look at the official Microsoft <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/excel" target="_blank">help site for Excel</a>.  It's fantastic!  If you use Excel and haven't seen it before, I highly recommend it.  It gives you access to all of the tutorial and help files that are exposed via mouseover tips inside the product. The added bonus is that it also has a good search function and you can see the information in a separate window, so you don't have to waste your screen real estate inside Excel.</p>

                    <p><strong>TL; DR</strong>  - I tried <a href="https://simplenote.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Simplenote</a> and I really like it.  Depending on what you want to do, <a href="https://evernote.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Evernote</a> might have features that you'll like.</p>

  <p>I'm a note-taker, can't help myself,  if I'm honest about it.  I have paper notebooks all over the place with various thoughts, reminders, ToDo lists etc.  I've extended this habit digitally as well and keep a "Work Log" in which I record the things I've done during the day. This is especially useful to record any tech snippets that I discovered while doing something new. This has been a lifesaver when I've had to redo something esoteric and which I'd already forgotten. (Which seems to happen more and more these days.)  Recently, I've been taking classes, both Online and in person at UW, and have wanted to keep track of topics unique to each class in separate notes.  These notes are then used to help complete assignments and also to synthesize the information that's been presented in each class.  And finally, many of the ad hoc notes that I've made end up getting converted into HTML files and used as HowTos and user docs.  These various needs have exposed the inefficiencies and shortcomings of my existing/old process.</p>

  <p>Up until now, I stored notes as plain text files in Dropbox, or on GitHub. Dropbox kept them in sync and made them easy to access from different machines, but I had to have Dropbox running locally in order to edit them and sync the changes.  It also has only lukewarm support for  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Markdown syntax</a>. In particular, code blocks don't seem to be rendered properly.  GitHub supports Markdown extremely well, but who wants to store their whole life on GitHub?  I like it for documentation that accompanies a project that's stored there, but for personal notes, especially ones that I want to edit on my phone, GitHub isn't a viable solution.  So what else is out there?</p>

  <p>Turns out that there are a ton of options available.  Two alternatives that I've tried out this week are Evernote and Simplenote.  Both have in-browser and installed apps and allow you to organize notes, but beyond that, they are radically different.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank rel="nofollow">Evernote</a></h2>

  <p>Evernote tries hard to be an all-in-one document editor.  It has options to control font style and size, whether text is centered, left or right-justified etc.  You can export to PDF, embed web pages or images in the doc - heck you can even embed an audio recording.  <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s641/sh/ccbae626-50b5-4bd2-8a59-4f069bd53039/1533260d36520060d461f8120e64e02d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here's</a> an example of an Evernote page saved as a Web page.  An additional feature it has (which Simplenote lacks) is the option to create notebooks to organize notes.  For me, it borders one being more than I need and it suffers from 2 deal-breakers.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>It doesn't support Markdown, eschewing it instead for built-in formatting controls like you'd see in Word.</li>
  <li>It only supports 2 devices before you have to pay for it.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I can live with the pay wall concept - heck I even support it for something that I like and use,  but the lack of Markdown is a problem for me.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://simplenote.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Simplenote</a></h2>

  <p>Simplenote is far less flashy than it's counterpart.  It pretty much gives you what it implies - a simple interface for making text-based notes and storing them.  But where it really shines in comparison to Evernote is in it's built-in Markdown support.  <a href="https://app.simplenote.com/p/tzTZwn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a> is a note written up in Markdown and then published from Simplenote to the web.  It lacks the Notebook feature Evernote has, but by using tags, you can easily accomplish the same thing.  I've tried the Web, Android and Windows apps and they all seem to work really well.  An added bonus that I've captured in the screenshot above is the "Dark" mode setting which mimics the black background found in most of today's code editors.</p>

      <div class="post-image-meta">
          <h3>SimpleNote screenshot</h3>

  <p>So for now, I'm sticking with Simplenote.</p>

                            2018 feels like a year for new beginnings and a good time to clean out old junk.  In that spirit, I've decided to give my old blog a kick in the pants.  A few of the goals I have in mind for this incarnation are:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Simpler page creation process to enable faster publishing</li>
                              <li>Cleaner, more flexible layout that responds well to mobile devices</li>
                              <li>Leveraging the github.io domain for Web page hosting</li>
                              <li>Organized storage of one-liners and snippets for personal use</li>
                              <li>Sharing of useful tech-related insights</li>
                              <li>Updates on hobby projects for friends and family</li>
                              <li>Rants, let's not forget about the rants.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>
                          I've decided to use <a href="https://purecss.io/" target="_blank">Pure.CSS</a> as the basis for the site.  I don't know much about the project, but the pages look nice and the CSS seems to respond to my crude manipulations.  Editing and creation of base entries will be done in <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom.io</a> using a couple Markdown packages to generate GitHub flavored Markdown, which will then get jammed into templates. (See "crude CSS manipulation" above.)  We'll see how it goes, but hopefully it'll all "just work".  And if not, well it's all just a learning experience anyhow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Short, announcement-style, entries will just get tacked above this one, organized by date.  Longer and more expository pieces will get filed under the "Sections" button to the left.  It's disabled at the moment, but hopefully I'll have some stuff in there by the end of this week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Feel free to leave me feedback, or point me to intersting things via Twitter.
                        </p>
