<p>Meet Gabby, the Frontier Gibberish Blazer.  It's my new daily driver and my intent is to fix it up and modify it slightly to run the <a href="https://ridebdr.com/WABDR" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WABDR</a> with it.  I wanted a small, body-on-frame 4x4 and while the S10 Blazer, with its IFS (independent front suspension), will never be as trail-capable as a solid-front-axle Jeep, I think it'll do the job.  But first I need to get it running again and fix just about everything.</p>
<p>Gabby's last owner was an older lady who recently passed away.  She bought it new in 1984 and at some point in the '90s, she had the original 2.8 Liter V6 engine replaced with a 3.4 Liter V6 crate motor that was sold by GM as a direct replacement.  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate_Engine" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate_Engine</a>)  A bit later, the front driveline started to make a bad noise and her husband decided that, "she doesn't need 4WD", and removed the front driveshaft (among other things) to eliminate the noise as well as any motive power to the front wheels.  She drove it that way for a little while and then became ill and essentially it sat until she passed away.  Her daughter and grandson tried to get it running recently and gave up after throwing a bunch of parts at it in the hopes of making it work.  Next thing you know, I brought it home for $600.</p>
<h2>Major Issues</h2>
<p>So what's wrong with this thing?  Wellâ€¦ many, many things and it's a vehicle from the '80s, when music was great but engine emission controls were not.  According to the daughter and grandson, "it'll run for about a minute but then dies", which very much sounds like a carburetor problem, but could be something else too.  It also appears to have a wet right-rear brake drum and a crazy amount of negative camber on the front-left wheel.  And it's rusty all over and disgusting on the inside.  It's a mess.</p>
<p>For the moment, this is the only way it's getting around.</p>
