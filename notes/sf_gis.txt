Sometime ago, a former coworker told me that they thought using R for GIS was one of the dumbest things they had ever heard of.  I have to imagine they didn't really have any firsthand knowledge of the topic, as my experience tells me R is VERY capable of being used to do GIS tasks.  Plenty of quality GIS work has been done in R with long-standing libraries like [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) and [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html).  However, the release of the [sf package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) a few years ago made R even more powerful and easier to use for GIS.  Using the same underlying libraries as PostGIS; GDAL, GEOS and PROJ - sf now shares a very similar command syntax and data model with a tool that is known as one of the finest GIS applications ever built.  One thing R does better though is to actually provide a visualization interface for simple maps using the base _plot_ command.
