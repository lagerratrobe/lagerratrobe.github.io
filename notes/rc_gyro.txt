# RC Model Aytogyro

Some hobbies are hard to get out of your blood and aeromodelling is definitely one of those for me.  I've been fascinated with remote control planes since I was a little kid and dabbled in the hobby at various times in my life. Never successfully, I might add.  I've made planes, flown them a few times, crashed them, then bought more materials and kits which I never used and then stored for decades, etc. Despite that, I always eventually come back to it.

After each break, there is a period of readjustment needed, as technology has moved on from where it was the last time I dabbled in the field.  Invariably, this means having to learn about new things and buying new pieces of equipment that didn't exist previouslly.  I have to admit that the break this time, from roughly 2007 until 2022 has been jarring though.  Many, many things have changed in that time, some for the better and some things are gone that I truly miss.
