Gaunt's Ghosts book notes.


Honour Guard

The Guns of Tanith
-----------------
The Ghosts are deployed to the world of Phantine to help retake the vital chemical processing centers of Cirenholm and Ouranberg.  Polluted by centuries of manufacturing, Phantine's domed cities are up in the clouds, high above the toxic chemical soup found at the surface of the planet  Here, armies are transported by giant dirigibles, air assaults are the norm and the Ghosts face their most challenging enemy, the Blood Pact.

Internal demons also plague the 1st and Only at Phantine, as frictions emerge between the Veghasite augmentees and the native Tanith.  Gaunt must make difficult choices to show that he will treat both groups equally, choices that eventually lead to Bragg's death.  Lijah Cuu's psychotic and murderous character are fully revealed here and his rivalry with Bragg and Larkin take on a new intensity.
