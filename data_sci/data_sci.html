    <p>As a GIS professional for the past 12 years, I've seen our industry change pretty dramatically during that time. &nbsp;The days when we could expect to find work doing spatial analysis and making paper maps are long gone for all but the few of us who work for local governments. &nbsp;Even there, friends who work in those types of positions have told me that they are having to fight for their jobs and, in many cases, have been subsumed by IT departments, rather than being in the Resource or Planning groups that they started in. &nbsp;Like many things, the definition of our profession has morphed in the same way that musical genres morph over time. &nbsp;As a kid, I was aware of a genre named "Metal". &nbsp;Now, you can watch 12 episodes of the excellent series,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Evolution">Metal Evolution</a>&nbsp;to realize that what I was really listening to is called "The New Wave of British Heavy Metal", or NWOBHM, not just "Metal". &nbsp;GIS isn't just about spatial analysis or paper maps anymore, and it hasn't been for a long time. <br />
<br />
So what's happened to the field and what sort of work is being done now that still uses the term "GIS"? &nbsp;There are of course the traditional map data vendors like HERE and Pitney Bowes, who still employ large staffs of "GIS" people to process and assemble data sets that are mostly composed of road vectors and points of interest like business addresses. &nbsp;These are then sold to service providers that use them to power routing and navigation solutions, address level geocoding and in some cases Web Maps. Then there are the service providers themselves, like Google, Bing, Apple and others, who do "stuff" with the data and then dump into backing stores which are then read by map services and other location based services. &nbsp;These service providers all have some sort of "GIS" personnel who can quality check and shepherd the data into the various places that the services consume them from. &nbsp;Then there are places like Zillow, who both create data and run services. Some data they produce and some they get elsewhere. &nbsp;They have GIS staff who do analysis and some data munging, but are not responsible directly for the service upkeep. &nbsp;They are engaged more in a research capacity and advisory role, which is more similar to the traditional definition of GIS analysts than the other places. &nbsp;They are the minority though, and most of the GIS analysts there are also responsible for other types of data analysis as well. &nbsp;What all of these places have in common though is that the map itself has become a distinct separate thing from the data layers shown on them. <br />
<br />
Maps used to be lovingly hand-crafted for each analysis projects, with great attention paid to using the "perfect" projection and to having annotation layers that were "just right" to convey a story. &nbsp;Now, maps are a commodity over which data layers are shown. &nbsp;The same base map is used over and over and delivered as tiles or vectors from a service. &nbsp;Google Maps proved resoundingly that people don't care what map projection is used. &nbsp;Machine learning has helped make automatic label placement algorithms even better than when <a href="https://gis.e-education.psu.edu/sites/default/files/capstone/kern_CP60_20080401.pdf">this paper</a>&nbsp;was published, and most of us have gotten used to seeing maps that are "good enough", as opposed to the "perfect" ones from 15 years ago. &nbsp;Since the maps have been commoditized, the real money lies in the layers that are shown over them and that's where we, as GIS professionals, still have a place.<br />
<br />
There is a small problem there though. &nbsp;It used to be that geographic data, or data with a spatial component, was available only to people who worked in a few narrow fields. &nbsp;Now, location-based attributes are attached to every sort of data under the sun. &nbsp;This means that location-based analysis is no longer the purview of just GIS professionals. &nbsp;In fact, I would argue that GIS Analysis is not even a distinct profession anymore, but merely a facet of the larger field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Data Science</a>. &nbsp;What we need to consider then, as GIS professionals, is that we need to be able to do other types of analyses than just spatial ones. &nbsp;And since the Map is really not all that important anymore (which many of us knew a long time ago), we also need to be able to show the results of our analyses in a graphic that is not a map. &nbsp;These are the sorts of things that Data Science teaches and that I intend to learn more about.<br />
<br />
So that's my goal in this Blog, to track the things I'm learning about the larger field of Data Science and to record them here.</p>
